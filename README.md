Hi, Iâ€™m Ajay. A big time Data science enthusiast.

My beautiful journey into the world of Analytics started in 2016 when I started my first job after undergraduation. Shocked by V lookup in excel, I was left pondering how a simple formula can bring all required respective numbers in a column.I t was pure magic of programming and functions. It's been Five years and there is no turning back. From writing R and Python codes to applying statistical concepts, each day has been a stepping stomne toward deep learning.
- I have Five years of working experience, where I get to work with experts from the Finance and operation industry. I understood supply chain, and operational flow of deliveries. Most importantly, I learnt how important it has become for each industry to utilise historical data for better business conduct.
- This Fall, I joined California state university to pursue my Masters OF Science in Business Analytics at California state university. I think as I am 100% sure of advancing my career deep into data science, I feel this is the best time for me to go to college and understand business and data thoroughly.

I would welcome anyone looking to collaborate or just to have a normal conversation. One can contact me on Linkedin. https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajay-analyst/
